Static keyword and initializer block
initializer block is mostly need for OCA exam)
Review===>
===^_^===>>> Constructor is a 
--->>> a block of code that runs when object is made
--->>> it has same nams as class name
--->>> it has no return type
--->>> public Person(){}
--->>> public Person(String name){}
 
===^_^===>>> Default behavior of compiler;
--->>> if we don't have any contructor;
---->>> compiler will provide one
---->>> it is no-arg constructor with empty body
---->>> it is a default constructor
--->>> if we have any contructor;
---->>> compiler will not provide the default constructor
===^_^===>>> What is constructor mostly used for?
---> creating object with initial state
---> initialize all field value along with the creation
===^_^===>>> Some keywords; ---> to create an object
---> instantiating a class
---> create instance of a class
===^_^===>>> Constructor chaining
---> Where can we call a constructor?
it can only be called in another constructor of a same class
using this(args...)
---> Calling one constructor in another constructor
---> Rules in chaining
1- this(args...) has the be the first stamement in constructo body
2- can be called only once in one constructor
3- recursive call should be avoided or it will not compile
* you call me, I call you ==> recurse
* public Student(){
*this("spartan") bad call!!!
* sysout 
}
* public Student (String name){}
===^_^===>>> Purpose of using constructor chaining
---> Dry principle -- do not repeat yourself
---> code reusability and maintainability
WARM UP TASK 1 : 

	Create a class called SlackUser
		private fields  name , email , groupNum
		
		provide getters and setters for above fileds 
		
		create 3 args constructor to set all the field value

		create no arg constructor to set default value 
			by calling 3 args constructor 
			you may set default value to your own info 

		create toString method accept no arg 
			return info about the slack user object 

		create a method called sendMessage
		accept two parameters 
			  channel as string , content as String 
		it just print out User <your name>
				sent message <content> to channel <channel>


	Create another class called SlackAction 
		create few objects , call their methods
